# Savage Wilds Community Map Project

### What is this?
It's a community-built map for the [Savage Wilds](https://savagewilds.com/) mod map for the Conan Exiles video game.

The old map on WorldAnvil was outdated, and was eventually taken down by it's creator as it created more confusion than
it did good.  This left us without a map at all.  I took up the mantle to replace it and here we are!

### How do I help?

#### I see a problem on the map
Is the map not working right for you?  Is there a typo?  Do you disagree with something in it?  Want to submit a
subjectively better screenshot for a particular item location?  Please 
[Click Here](https://github.com/SavageWildsMap/map/issues/new) and select `Report a Map Problem`.
#### I have a new marker pin to add! 
Help me document pins and locations!  This is hard and I am NOT using the data files or mod files to document the pins,
so I am at the mercy of my own exploration of the mod.  If you know of a location for something that needs to be added,
please open the map and on the layers menu (on the right side) choose `Add New Marker` then click to place a new pin.
#### I want something else
Joining the [Savage Wilds Discord](https://discord.gg/pcSf4PvVNs) server in 
the [General Spoilers](https://discord.com/channels/775129118135287828/899442929121239070) channel is the best place for
discussion!  I'm always lurking there.
